# __LinkedIn Job Searching__
#### Liam Creedon - Fall 2021

## User Research
Who are the users?
* Individuals looking for employment, most typically in a corporate setting.

What is the design focus and problem space?
* The design focus is centered around features users find relevant while searching for jobs. The features are discovered from a combination of prior research and personal experience as a user, and from contextual inquiry. 
* Main problems
  * In-direct job searching
    * Not a position title search, but can users be given the ability to search based on skill sets, experience level, hiring windows, company/industry types...?
  * Resume comparison
    * Profile is compared with post, skill badges too, but can we see how a user's resume matches based on keywords, skills, personal values...?
  * Saved jobs filtering and ordering
    * Rather than just sequential, can we see filter this list based on similar criteria as actually searching for jobs?
  * Job alerts
    * Can users further customize alerts to be more intelligent and specific?

Why was this project picked?
* As someone searching the job market, I am often frustrated by the limitations of LinkedIn and find myself looking for workarounds. Job searching is already an un-exciting and daunting process, particularly as a college student that does not necessarily know what they want to pursue. Offering more flexibility and information in this process will allow for both an exploration and application aspect of the process.

## Contextual Inquiry
User - Olivia, a 21 year old 4th year at Hopkins. Olivia studies International Studies and Political Science and is from Louisville, KY. While Olivia has already accpeted a job offer for post graduation, she was exploring job options within the last 2 months.

### Task Overview
The user was asked to complete a set of tasks leveraging LinkedIn. The tasks asked were:
1. Search for some jobs that you are interested in and save them
2. Filter your search based on criteria relevant and important to you
3. Upload a new version/copy of your resume
4. Show how you would apply for one of the jobs you just saved
5. Turn on job alerts for this job, and customize as desired

### CI Summary

Task 1 - The user began with navigating to the 'Jobs' tab on LinkedIn, and then entered into the search bar the title of a job she is looking to pursue. She scanned the results, mentioning that within each listing she was looking for factors important to her (location, full time or part time, job functions, required experience, salary, benefits, company values). Some of these features the user mentioned were nice to see in a "quick-view", where they stood out immediately upon viewing the job posting. Others, she mentioned were lost in the length and detail of the post, leaving her wishing that postings were more concise and focused in general.

Task 2 - The user said that when searching, she does not often uses the filters and instead tends to just scan with her eyes. Of the filters listed at the top of the page, some were selected and the user quickly moved on, some were meet with interest conveyed by and exclamatory "Hmm!" or "Ooh!", and some were visited and the user immediately knew that this was a filter of interest to her. User did not explore the 'All filters' button to allow for further filtering, but did find that too much filtering yielded unhelpful or too few results (e.g. searched for 'Sustainability policy' and after applying filters was only getting results for jobs in a bakery).

Task 3 - Before even being asked about her resume, the user highlighted a key aspect of my research with the statement: "I wish LinkedIn knew my resume and would use it to help the searches." The user expressed the importance of a resume in helping her search for jobs and how she felt it would make searching easier and more intelligent, even saying that she has used slight variations of the document to apply to different positions. This being said, when asked to upload a new version of her resume to LinkedIn, the user struggled to determine how. She first navigated to her profile, clicking on an array of different buttons and options, including ignoring the option 'Build a resume' because "I already have a resume, I don't need to build a new one." When directed to the actual option to upload a resume, the user was entered into a process including many steps to adjust the resume and reformat. The result had generated new information and the user stated: "I never said those were my skills. I don't get why I have to do all of this again, this is dumb."

Task 4 - The user navigated relatively quickly to the location of saved jobs and was able to follow the proper process to get back to the job posting. Having spent very little time looking at the actual page of saved jobs, it conveyed a comfortability with the design of the page.
Task 5 - The user was able to quickly locate the button to set job alerts for the job she had just mocked and application for. When prompted to customize the alert that she had just set, the proper screen to do so was not evident to her. A notification popped up in the bottom left of the screen that the user did not immediately see, but once she noticed she was able to enter the proper interface. She noted the job alert customization screen "doesn't allow me to change everything about the alert", specifically that the frequency and notification method (email vs text) was the only aspect able to be modified, and not actually the job or location. Returning to the jobs tab, the user quickly saw where the default location to change alerts exists on the page.
 
## Sequence Modeling

## Paper Based Prototyping

For my redesign, I considered two primary interfaces of LinkedIn to visit: the 'homepage' of the 'Jobs' tab, and the search results when searching for jobs.

![LinkedIn Job search results](/docs/assets/images/jobSearch.png)

Key features I aimed to capture in my prototype were:
* Homepage
  * Highlighting frequently used features and making them more centric in the design
  * Minimzing extranneous or infrequently used features
  * Adding better resume functionality
  * Making job information relevant to the user immediately obvious

* Job search
  * Expanding filter options
  * Incorporating resume matching
  * Displaying saved jobs
