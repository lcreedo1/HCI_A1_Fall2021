## User Research
* Who are the users?
  * Users are individuals looking for employment, most typically in a corporate setting.
* What is the design focus and problem space?
  * The design focus is centered around features users find relevant while searching for jobs. The features are discovered from a combination of prior research and personal experience as a user, and from contextual inquiry. 
  * _Main problems_
    * In-direct job searching
      * Not a position title search, but the ability to search based on skill sets, experience level, hiring windows, company/industry types
    * Resume comparison
      * Profile compares, skill badges too, but can we see how the resume matches? Keywords, skills, personal valuesâ€¦
    * Saved jobs filtering and ordering
      * Rather than just sequential, can we see filter this list based on similar criteria as actually searching for jobs
    * Job alerts
      * More intelligent suggestions and specific notifications
* Why was this project picked?
  * As someone searching the job market, I am often frustrated by the limitations and workarounds offered on LinkedIn. Job searching is already an un-exciting and daunting process, particularly as a college student that does not necessarily know what they want to pursue. Offering more flexibility and information in this process will allow for both an exploration and application aspect of the process.
