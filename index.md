# __LinkedIn Job Searching__
#### Liam Creedon - Fall 2021

## User Research
Who are the users?
* Individuals looking for employment, most typically in a corporate setting.
What is the design focus and problem space?
* The design focus is centered around features users find relevant while searching for jobs. The features are discovered from a combination of prior research and personal experience as a user, and from contextual inquiry. 
* Main problems
  * In-direct job searching
    * Not a position title search, but can users be given the ability to search based on skill sets, experience level, hiring windows, company/industry types...?
  * Resume comparison
    * Profile is compared with post, skill badges too, but can we see how a user's resume matches based on keywords, skills, personal values...?
  * Saved jobs filtering and ordering
    * Rather than just sequential, can we see filter this list based on similar criteria as actually searching for jobs?
  * Job alerts
    * Can users further customize alerts to be more intelligent and specific?
Why was this project picked?
* As someone searching the job market, I am often frustrated by the limitations of LinkedIn and find myself looking for workarounds. Job searching is already an un-exciting and daunting process, particularly as a college student that does not necessarily know what they want to pursue. Offering more flexibility and information in this process will allow for both an exploration and application aspect of the process.

## Contextual Inquiry
Participant - Olivia, a 21 year old 4th year at Hopkins. Olivia studies International Studies and Political Science and is from Louisville, KY. While Olivia has already accpeted a job offer for post graduation, she was exploring job options within the last 2 months.

### Task Overview
Olivia was asked to complete a set of tasks leveraging LinkedIn. The tasks asked were:
1. Search for some jobs that you are interested in and save them
2. Filter your search based on criteria relevant and important to you
3. Upload a new version/copy of your resume
4. Show how you would apply for one of the jobs you just saved
5. Turn on job alerts for this job, and customize as desired
